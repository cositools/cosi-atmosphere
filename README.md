# cosi-atmosphere

## Introduction  <br />
The purpose or this library is to provide tools for dealing with atmospheric effects in gamma-ray astronomy. Currently, only the atmospheric response module is available, but future versions of the code will include modules for atmoshperic backgrounds, albedo emission, and reflection.
